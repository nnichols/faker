A Clojure library for generating fake HTTP requests for [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring).

> Faker is a negative word, but it's still cool.
> - Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok from [*SK Telecom T1*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faker_(gamer))

## Installation

A deployed copy of the most recent version of [nature can be found on clojars.](https://clojars.org/nnichols/faker)
To use it, add the following as a dependency in your `project.clj` file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/nnichols/faker/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/nnichols/faker)

The next time you build your application, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) should pull it automatically.
Alternatively, you may clone or fork the repository to work with it directly.

## Usage

All functions necessary to generate requests are provided in the core namespace.
To create a fake request, simply specify the HTTP method and resource you'd like to access:

```clojure
(:require [faker.core :as faker])

(def get-request
  (faker/mock-request :get "/v1/resource"))

;; => {:protocol "HTTP/1.1",
;;    :server-port 8080,
;;    :server-name "localhost",
;;    :remote-addr "127.0.0.1",
;;    :uri "/v1/resource",
;;    :scheme :http,
;;    :request-method :get,
;;    :headers {"host" "localhost:8080"}}
```

This request is ready to pass directly to your Ring server for testing.
Since your application's middleware and routes are highly configurable, the `mock-request` function also accepts an optional map to customize the request.
The following options are supported:

- `protocol`: The HTTP protocol version to use. Defaults to HTTP/1.1
- `scheme`: The URI request scheme to use. Defaults to :http
- `hostname`: The URI request target hostname. Defaults to localhost
- `port`: The URI request port number. If the scheme is :https, default is set to 443. Otherwise, 8080
- `custom-route?`: A flag to determine if `resource` should be treated as a fully qualified route. Defaults to false, meaning the URI will be constructed from the `scheme`, `hostname`, `port`, and `resource`
- `headers`: A map of HTTP headers to add onto the request.
- `cookies`: A map of HTTP cookies to add onto the request.
- `content-type`: The HTTP content type the request should be sent with. Defaults to `application/json` for `body-type` :json, `application/xml` for `body-type` :xml, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for `body-type` :form. For `body-type` inferred, rely on content-type detection in `ring-mock`
- `content-length`: The HTTP content length in bytes for the request. If `body-type` != :raw, `ring-mock` will calculate this value for you.
- `body-type`: The keyword type of content in the request body, which is used to determine how to serialize EDN into the appropriate content-type and to set the `content-type` Expects one of :raw, :xml, :json, :form, :inferred. For :raw, assoc the `body` onto the request as is For :json, serialize the `body` with `cheshire` and set `content-type` to `application/json` For :xml, serialize the `body` with `clojure.data.xml` and set `content-type` to `application/xml` For :form, serialize the `body` as with `ring-mock` and set `content-type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` For :inferred, use the automatic parsing in `ring-mock` and have it set the appropriate `content-type` Defaults to :inferred
- `body`: The body of the request to serialize according to `body-type`
- `query-parameters`: A map of query parameters to encode and add onto the request.

For example

```clojure
(faker/mock-request :get "/" {:headers   {"auth" "my-secure-token"}
                              :body-type :json
                              :body      {:key 123}
                              :scheme    :https})

;; => {:protocol "HTTP/1.1",
;;     :remote-addr "127.0.0.1",
;;     :headers {"host" "localhost:443", "content-type" "application/json", "content-length" "11", "auth" "my-secure-token"},
;;     :server-port 443,
;;     :content-length 11,
;;     :content-type "application/json",
;;     :uri "/",
;;     :server-name "localhost",
;;     :body #object[java.io.ByteArrayInputStream 0x1f314cee "java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@1f314cee"],
;;     :scheme :https,
;;     :request-method :get}
```

Since most applications will use [standard HTTP methods,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) several aliased versions exist.
These functions support the exact same options as `mock-request`

```clojure
(faker/get "/" {:headers   {"auth" "my-secure-token"}
                :body-type :json
                :body      {:key 123}
                :scheme    :https})

;; => {:protocol "HTTP/1.1",
;;     :remote-addr "127.0.0.1",
;;     :headers {"host" "localhost:443", "content-type" "application/json", "content-length" "11", "auth" "my-secure-token"},
;;     :server-port 443,
;;     :content-length 11,
;;     :content-type "application/json",
;;     :uri "/",
;;     :server-name "localhost",
;;     :body #object[java.io.ByteArrayInputStream 0x1f314cee "java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@1f314cee"],
;;     :scheme :https,
;;     :request-method :get}
```

Currently supported methods are:

- GET
- HEAD
- PUT
- DELETE
- CONNECT
- OPTIONS
- TRACE
- PATCH

Each of these HTTP methods corresponds 1:1 with a lowercase function name in `faker.core`

This library currently _does not_ attempt to coerce requests or enforce HTTP standards and best practices on generated requests.
For example, you may create a GET request with a body.
This can be helpful when writing middleware/handlers for malformed or malicious requests.
